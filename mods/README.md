# mods/

Optional additions to the game, each switched on by putting it here.
Nothing in this folder is needed to play, and git ignores everything in it but this file.

## Installing with get.py

`tools/mods/get.py` downloads a mod from where its authors publish it and installs it here, removing that mod's previous install first:

```sh
python3 tools/mods/get.py textures    # the UHD texture pack, into mods/textures/GMS, and the extras
python3 tools/mods/get.py extras      # only the extras, into mods/textures/sms-hd-texture-extras
python3 tools/mods/get.py eclipse     # Super Mario Eclipse, patched from your disc, into mods/eclipse, and its maps
python3 tools/mods/get.py eclipse-maps  # only the radar's maps of Eclipse's stages, into mods/maps/eclipse
python3 tools/mods/get.py language fr  # the French language pack, into mods/languages/fr (de, es, it, pl)
python3 tools/mods/get.py lua         # the lua mod, into mods/lua: runs Lua script mods (native mods, below)
python3 tools/mods/get.py all
```

It needs 7-Zip (`7z`, `7zz` or `7za`) to unpack the downloads, and checks each against the release it expects.
The texture pack is about 1 GB to download and 3 GB installed.
The extras are [HD textures the UHD pack lacks](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-hd-texture-extras), such as the boot logo, GAME OVER, the pause guide's pictures, HUD icons, Peach and some stage textures; they are about 65 MB, need no 7-Zip, and `get.py extras` adds or updates them without downloading the UHD pack again.
Their release is pinned in `tools/mods/texture-extras.json` and the install records it in `mods/textures/sms-hd-texture-extras/.release`; `get.py extras --if-outdated` downloads only when the two differ, which is how SMS Launcher brings existing installs up to a new release.
Eclipse is about 850 MB to download; it is an xdelta patch that turns your own North American ISO (found as `--iso PATH`, `SMS_DISC_IMAGE`, `disc_image` in `settings.txt`, or the image in `rom/`) into a Super Mario Eclipse ISO, which the installer checks against the expected result.
Already have Eclipse? `get.py eclipse --eclipse-iso PATH` installs the v1.1.0 ISO Eclipse's own patcher made (the same file, checked by its MD5) with no download: it is linked into `mods/eclipse` when it is on the same drive, and copied when not. `--archive PATH` uses the release you downloaded yourself (`super_mario_eclipse_v110.7z`, checked by its MD5, and left where it is) instead of downloading it, and still patches your disc.
The radar's maps of Eclipse's stages come with it (`mods/maps/eclipse`, made from Eclipse's disc by `tools/radar/gen_maps.py --except assets/maps/maps.txt`): pinned in `tools/mods/eclipse-maps.json` and recorded in the install's `.release` like the extras, so `get.py eclipse-maps --if-outdated` brings an install up to a new release. If they cannot be downloaded, Eclipse is still installed, and its stages that are not the retail game's have no radar.
`--keep-download` keeps the downloaded archives in `mods/.downloads/`.

## textures/: HD texture packs

Texture packs made for Dolphin's "Load Custom Textures" work unchanged.
Unpack one into `mods/textures/` (or let `get.py textures` install the UHD pack), for example the [Super Mario Sunshine UHD Texture Pack](https://github.com/qashto/Super_Mario_Sunshine_UHD_Texture_Pack) (from its `GMS.7z` release, `GMS/Textures/GMS` goes to `mods/textures/GMS`).
Every `tex1_*.png` and `tex1_*.dds` below `mods/textures/` is used, in any sub-folder; several packs can sit side by side.
The one exception is a folder named `widescreen_stars_fix`: the UHD pack's blanks the star particle of Mario's wall bonk and a stunned Cataquack, to hide stars Dolphin's widescreen hack shows, which the port's widescreen does not.
DDS files can hold BC1–BC3 or BC7 blocks or plain RGBA. Supported blocks stay compressed, including files with only one or a few mipmap levels: the missing levels are made from the last one in the background after the level loads and compressed in the same format, so far-away surfaces do not shimmer (until they arrive, about a second of four cores for an 8192×8192 image, sampling stops at the file's last level). A GPU that cannot sample BC7 (macOS) gets them decoded instead.
A cut-out (a fence, grate or leaf, with alpha mostly clear or opaque) replacing a mipmapped texture keeps its coverage in the levels made for it: as much of each passes the alpha test as in the file's last level, or in the game's own level of that size if more, and its colours are weighted by alpha. Plain averaging thins such strands until they vanish a few metres away (Pinna Park's climbing cage) and darkens them with the clear texels' colour.
A replacement for a greyscale texture (I4, I8, IA4 or IA8) that has almost no fully clear texels but a tenth or more at one alpha below 16 has that floor removed: the UHD pack's palm shadows (Delfino Plaza, Pinna Park, the airstrip) and an airstrip cloud are about 1–3% opaque where the game's own textures are clear, which drew a faint dark square around each shadow. Such a texture is kept uncompressed.
The missing levels are made at the lowest processor and disk priority, so they use idle time rather than slowing the game, and are kept in the cache folder (`texture-mips/` in `~/.cache/sms-port`, `~/Library/Caches/sms-port` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\sms-port` on Windows; the UHD pack's come to about 1 GB once every level has been seen), so each is made once. A cached file is used only while its source keeps the size and date it was made from. `SMS_TEXTURE_PACK_CACHE=dir` keeps them elsewhere; `=0` makes them every session instead.

A pack names each image after the texture it replaces (its size, format and a hash of its data), so it matches the game's own textures wherever they are loaded.
Replacements in loaded BTI files, models and particle resources prepare in the background, including textures on offscreen objects. Before the first gameplay frame, the render thread finishes uploading the queued replacements. This adds some loading time and avoids doing those uploads when the camera first sees an object.
Textures created or fetched later show their original until the replacement is ready. Normal draws only request or bind replacements; uploads run at frame boundaries, at most `SMS_TEXTURE_PACK_UPLOAD_MB` (8 by default; `0` for no limit) or 2 ms a frame, and a large image is sent in pieces of 4 MiB over several frames, each small enough for the GL thread to take without the game waiting for it. A replacement is drawn once all its levels are in.

`SMS_TEXTURE_PACK_PRELOAD` (`texture_pack_preload` in `settings.txt`) sets when replacements load: `1`, the default, as above; `all` also reads the rest of the pack in the background from the start and sends it to the GPU during loading screens only (up to 1.5 s of each, after the level's own), keeping all of it, so after the first few loads nothing loads at all (like Dolphin's "Prefetch Custom Textures"; the UHD pack then takes about 4 GB of video memory, past `SMS_TEXTURE_PACK_MB`); `0` loads each replacement when it is first drawn.
They look best with a larger internal resolution, for example `SMS_GX_SCALE=2`.

Switches: `SMS_TEXTURE_PACKS=dir;dir` uses those folders instead of `mods/textures/`, `SMS_TEXTURE_PACKS=0` turns packs off, and `SMS_TEXTURE_PACK_LOG=1` logs the pack name of every texture the game loads and whether it was replaced (for checking a pack or making one).

`SMS_MARIO_LOOK=dir` is the launcher's Customize Mario: Mario's textures repainted in the player's colours, as a pack named after the textures it replaces. It's read before every other pack, so its images win (no other pack's mip levels are mixed in), and it still applies with `SMS_TEXTURE_PACKS=0`.

To make a pack, run with `SMS_TEXTURE_DUMP=dir`: every texture the game loads is written there once as a PNG under its pack name.
Edit or upscale the images, keep the names, and put them under `mods/textures/`.
Replacements take more video memory than the original textures; their cost depends on resolution and GPU compression support.
Past `SMS_TEXTURE_PACK_MB` (1536 by default), the replacements unused for longest are freed, and read again when needed.
The decoder pauses when images awaiting upload reach `SMS_TEXTURE_PACK_PENDING_MB` (256 by default), allowing at most one additional decoded result. This budget excludes decode scratch space and GPU memory. `SMS_TEXTURE_PACK_SYNC=1` restores synchronous first-use loading for repeatable captures and bypasses preloading and upload limits. The matching settings are `texture_pack_preload`, `texture_pack_pending_mb` and `texture_pack_upload_mb` in `settings.txt`.

## Native mods

A folder here with a `mod.ini` and a shared library is a native mod: a program of its own the game loads at start, which can hear of the game's events, change the game, draw over it and add settings to the Mods menu (F1).
Any number run together, and a mod built for the game's API version runs with every build of the game, so mods are made and released apart from it.

- **Writing one:** the [mod SDK](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-mod-sdk) (here as the `sdk/` submodule) and its manual, [MODDING.md](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-mod-sdk/blob/main/docs/MODDING.md), with every event and function.
- **Templates and examples** to start from: [sms-mod-templates](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-mod-templates) (C, C++ and Lua templates; the `hello`, `trainer-hud`, `stage-timer` and `lua-challenges` examples, also prebuilt on its releases page).
- **Lua script mods** (`runtime = lua` in their `mod.ini`) run in the **lua** mod, which is optional: `python3 tools/mods/get.py lua` installs it in `mods/lua` (from the [SDK's releases](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-mod-sdk/releases)). Without it the Mods menu lists script mods as needing it.

## <name>/files/: game file mods

A mod that changes the game's files (models, stages, textures inside archives, text) goes in `mods/<name>/files/`, laid out like the disc's own `files/` folder, and is switched on with `mod = <name>` in `settings.txt` (or `SMS_MOD=<name>`; several as `a;b`, a later one winning).
Each file there takes the place of the disc's file at the same path, or is added to the disc if it has none; everything else still comes from your disc image.
The log names each mod and how many files it replaced and added.

This covers mods that only change data.
Mods that also change the game's code, such as Super Mario Eclipse, need that code ported too; see [docs/ECLIPSE.md](../docs/ECLIPSE.md).

## languages/: language packs

`language = <code>` in `settings.txt` (`SMS_LANGUAGE`) plays the game in that language with the pack in `languages/<code>/`: `fr`, `de`, `es`, `it` or `pl`; `en`, the default, is the disc's own English.
`get.py language <code>` installs one; its release is pinned in `tools/mods/language-packs.json`, and `--if-outdated` downloads only when the installed one (recorded in `languages/<code>/.release`) is not that release.

A pack's `files/` is laid out like a game file mod's, with one addition: a folder named after one of the disc's archives holds files that replace the ones of the same path inside that archive (`files/data/scene/bianco0.szs/map/message.bmg`).
The port rebuilds such an archive when the game opens it, so a pack holds only what changes.
Mods named with `mod` are applied after the language pack: a mod's own copy of an archive wins over the language's files inside it.
